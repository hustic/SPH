* ACSE-4-SPH

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics][Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics]] (SPH) is a meshless
method for solving the Navier-Stokes equation, in which fluid properties are stored on Lagrangian fluid particles (i.e. on
particles which move with the fluid flow). The particles interact to generate values across the entire fluid domain through
continuous smoothing kernels.

As the SPH method is meshless and Lagrangian, it is ideal for solving problems involving fluid flow with interfaces and free
surfaces. This tool implements the SPH method in C++ to solve wave generation in a lock-release/dam-break problem.

** Compilation/Installation Guide
A Makefile has been provided that builds the tool and places the executables in
the /bin/ folder. Reading through the Makefile is highly encouraged to see all
the options a user has for building and testing the tool. The simplest way to
compile is:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
#+END_SRC

Note, that the /post.py/ uses the /lxlm/ library. The installation of that
library changes from system to system. Users are thus encouraged to check out
the [[https://lxml.de/installation.html][installation page on the lxlm website]].

Also note, that the testing routines use the BOOST library, which is another can
of worms. If you are using a Linux distribution (however) you can just use /apt-get/:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
#+END_SRC
, or any other package manager your distribution comes with.

** User instructions
After a successfull complilation, the user can run the tool with his/her desired
initial configuration, by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./bin/SPH_2D input.txt
#+END_SRC

The /input.txt/ should look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
30.0  <-- length of the simulation in seconds
0.05  <-- time-step to output to disk
0.2   <-- dx
0     <-- switch off analysisMode (to be deprecated)
-0.6 -0.6 0.1 10.7 1   <-- Define bottom left and top right corners (first 4)
0.0 10.0 20.0 10.7 1   <-- 5th argument is the type of particle (1 for boundary)
20.0 -0.6 20.6 10.7 1
0.0 -0.6 20.0 0.1 1
0.2 0.2 3.1 5.1 0
3.2 0.2 19.9 2.1 0
#+END_SRC


** Documentation
Extensive Documentation has been written for both the tool and its testing
routines.
You can either check the [[https://github.com/acse-2019/acse-4-sph-ness/blob/master/Documentation.md][Markdown version]] (incomplete :( ),  [[https://github.com/acse-2019/acse-4-sph-ness/blob/master/Documentation.org][emacs org-mode
version]] (no latex functions unfortunately), [[https://github.com/acse-2019/acse-4-sph-ness/blob/master/Documentation.pdf][pdf version]].

** Testing

The tool includes tests, which you can use to check its operation on your system. With the code compiled, these can be run
with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python run_tests.py
#+END_SRC

If you are on a Linux distribution and you want to compile and run the complete
testing routines, you can use:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make runtests
#+END_SRC
